<h2>PMI</h2>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> We spent alot of time on the website and completed it in a timely manner. The project was not done at the last minute but was work on periodically throughout the allocated time period. We were able to collaborate effectively using github and share each others work. Slack was also a very useful tool to communicate and allowed the group to decide on times to meet up and discuss the project.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Our group had troubles sharing the workload across group members.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> We learned how important it is to collaborate with projects and the amount of work required help from all members. We learned that different members have differenct skill sets that help with the project in different ways</p>

                    <p>Jenny Carr came to Australia from Scotland in the early 70s and instantly became an integral part of
                        the Townsville music scene as a pianist and instrumental music teacher. In 1998 when the decision
                        was made to establish a community orchestra, Jenny worked as librarian, performer and for many years
                        as Manager . In conjunction with Donna McMahon and Susan Linge (from the Civic Theatre), they arranged
                        a series of concerts for the emerging orchestra. She also played with the orchestra when a pianist
                        was needed. As Manager, she was involved in all aspects of handling the orchestra's music and checking
                        attendances. In later years, Jenny worked as Adjudicator’s Assistant for the Australian Vocal and

                    <h3>Stephen Frewen-Lord</h3>
                    <h4><em>Life Member since May 2015</em></h4>
                    <p>Stephen has been involved with the Barrier Reef Orchestra since its inception; having played as concert
                        master in the orchestra’s inaugural concert in 2000. Since then, he has missed only a couple of Barrier
                        Reef Orchestra concerts, and has been concert master for most concerts. When not rehearsing with
                        the BRO, Stephen is involved in a number of ensembles around Townsville. He manages and plays with
                        the Melaleuca String Quartet, directed Strings Non Troppo, and plays in Double Play – a guitar/violin
                        duo. Stephen has had regular involvement with the Mulkadee Arts Festival, and performs regularly
                        in community events such as Eco Fiesta, Riverfest, Heritage Day and Stable on the Strand. In his
                        role as concert master over the past 15 years, Stephen has enjoyed many discussions with guest conductors
                        concerning the artistic direction of the orchestra. As a string teacher, he has encouraged many young
                        string players to become regular members of the orchestra. Stephen loves his involvement with the
                        orchestra, and is delighted to be joined by young players who share his passion for music. Stephen
                        is looking forward to passing on the baton to the next BRO concert master!</p>

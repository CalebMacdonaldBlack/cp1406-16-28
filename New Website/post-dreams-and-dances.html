                    <em>Conducted by - Richard McIntyre OAM, BMus (University of Sydney)</em>

                    <div class="content-panel-inner">
                        <p>Richard has maintained a long and distinguished career as bassoonist, music educator, conductor and
                            arranger. A Composition graduate from Sydney University, he was appointed Associate Principal
                            Bassoon with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as a 20-year-old in 1968, moving to The Canberra School
                            of Music as a foundation member of the Canberra Wind Soloists in 1978. With this renowned quintet,
                            he recorded and toured internationally during a 30-year period, and gave it a unique repertoire
                            with his virtuoso arrangements of large-scale orchestral works. He was for many years Principal
                            Bassoon with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, and appeared on many occasions as guest Principal
                            Bassoon with most of the Symphony Australia Orchestras - also as concerto soloist, and independently
                            as a recitalist. His continuing work as Principal Bassoon with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra
                            dates back to student days of 1965 - 67. If you'd like to hear some of his work as bassoonist,
                            chamber musician, and arranger, you'll find it on YouTube under Canberra Wind Soloists.</p>
                        <p>Simultaneously, he has sustained a career as one of Australia's most respected bassoon teachers,
                            at all levels from beginner to post-graduate and professional. In addition he has worked tirelessly
                            in the development of orchestral and ensemble skills with students of all instruments, particularly
                            at the advanced tertiary level. He was for many years a regular tutor and conductor at the Australian
                            Youth Orchestra's National Music Camps. He has taught over many years in south-east Asia.</p>
                        <p>His work as a conductor is well-known, particularly in Canberra. He was Conductor and Musical Director
                            of the Canberra Youth Orchestra from 1980 - 1990, greatly broadening its repertoire and general
                            endeavour, and led it on three highly-successful and widely-acclaimed European tours. His Canberra
                            contribution has included development of and much work with the School of Music Orchestra, Canberra
                            Opera, Canberra Philharmonic Society, thirteen-years as Musical Director of The Llewellyn Choir
                            (with development of its accompanying professional ensemble, The Canberra Chamber Orchestra),
                            and three years as Musical Director of The Oriana Chorale. </p>
                        <p>His numerous conducting activities outside of Canberra have included the foundation and development
                            of the Barrier Reef Orchestra, with which he continues his association as Artistic Advisor and
                            frequent conductor.</p>
                        <p>His 35-year career at the Canberra (now ANU) School of Music played a significant part in the creation
                            of its erstwhile international reputation. Awards have included 1986 Canberran of the Year, Advance
                            Australia, Sounds Australian, and National Critics' Circle awards. In 1992 he was granted an
                            Order of Australia Medal, for services to Music and Music Education, particularly for his work
                            with the Canberra Youth Orchestra. In 2013, he was elected President of the Australian Double
                            Reed Society.</p>
